# Fraud Detection System

A complete machine learning–based project that detects fraudulent transactions using Python. This project includes data preprocessing, model training & evaluation, exploratory data analysis(EDA), and deployment logic to identify fraud patterns and predict fraud with a tuned classifier.

## Objective

Financial fraud poses a significant risk to digital payment systems and financial institutions. The objective of this project is to **build an efficient machine learning model** that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

This project focuses on:
- Identifying patterns associated with fraudulent behavior  
- Handling class imbalance in fraud datasets  
- Training and evaluating classification models  
- Improving fraud detection using calibrated predictions

## Dataset Summary

The dataset consists of transaction-level records where each observation represents a single transaction. The target variable indicates whether the transaction is **fraudulent (1)** or **legitimate (0)**.

Key characteristics:
- Highly imbalanced dataset  
- Numerical transaction-related features  
- Binary classification target
