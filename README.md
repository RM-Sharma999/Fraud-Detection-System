## Project Overview

Financial fraud is a major challenge for banks, fintech platforms, and e-commerce systems. This project aims to build a **machine learning classifier** that distinguishes between fraudulent and legitimate transactions by analyzing historical transaction data.

The system follows an end-to-end ML workflow:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature transformation
- Model training & evaluation
- Insights into model performance
