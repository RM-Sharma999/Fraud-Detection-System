## Objective

Financial fraud poses a significant risk to digital payment systems and financial institutions. 

The objective of this project is to **build an efficient machine learning model** that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions based on historical transaction data.

This project focuses on:
- Identifying patterns associated with fraudulent behavior  
- Handling class imbalance in fraud datasets  
- Training and evaluating classification models  
- Improving fraud detection using calibrated predictions
